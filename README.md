## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

While learning more advanced tools like React, Astro, Tailwind, etc., I've enjoyed returning to these small, component-based projects in order to practice CSS fundamentals.

### Useful resources

- [HTML and CSS for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/html-and-css-for-beginners-build-a-project/) - Madison Kanna has published a free Udemy short course on HTML and CSS fundamentals that utilizes a walkthrough of this particular design. After completing this challenge, I enjoyed viewing her process and approach to the project. She offers a great intro to the topic and I believe her course offers beginners a nice starting point to build upon.
